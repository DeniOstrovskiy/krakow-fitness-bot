# Acceptance Testing for MuleSoft

## Scope and context
- Focus on UAT and business acceptance for MuleSoft APIs and integrations
- Assume MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, CloudHub or Runtime Fabric unless stated otherwise

## Always clarify
- Environment: dev, test, uat, prod
- Runtime: CloudHub, RTF, on prem
- API type: System, Process, Experience
- Auth: OAuth, Client ID and Secret, JWT, mTLS
- SLA or performance targets
- Version and deployment details
- Test data sources and access

## Acceptance focus areas
- Business requirements coverage and end to end flow
- Contract validation: RAML and examples
- Data mapping and transformations (DataWeave)
- Error handling: status codes, error payloads, retries, timeouts
- Idempotency and duplicate handling
- Security: auth, scopes, IP allowlist, secrets handling
- Observability: logs, correlation IDs, metrics
- Performance and rate limits at agreed thresholds
- Downstream dependencies and graceful degradation

## Test design guidance
- Start with a concise UAT checklist, then detailed scenarios
- Provide step by step requests with sample payloads and headers
- Include expected response body and status code
- Include negative and boundary cases
- Call out any mocks or stubs used for downstream systems

## Reporting
- Record API name, version, environment, deployment id
- Attach request and response samples
- Include correlation id or trace id when available

## Communication style
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide concrete steps and payload examples
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
