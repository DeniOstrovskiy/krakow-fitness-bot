# QA Salesforce: Core Workflow

## Context
- Any QA or testing task for Salesforce (Sales, Service, Experience, CPQ, etc.)
- Requirements analysis, test design, testing, acceptance, regression

## Rules
- Always clarify: environment type (sandbox, dev, uat, prod), build or version, user profile or role, active permission sets, feature flags or org settings.
- Use Salesforce terminology: objects, fields, record types, page layouts, validation rules, flows, process builder, apex triggers, profiles, permission sets, sharing rules.
- Minimum checks: happy path, negative path, boundary values, access rights (CRUD and FLS), automation (Flows or Triggers), reports and dashboards, integrations (if any).
- Provide a short checklist first, then a detailed plan if needed.
- Prefer step by step scenarios over abstract advice.
