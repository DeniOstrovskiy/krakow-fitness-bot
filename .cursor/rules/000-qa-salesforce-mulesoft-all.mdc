# QA Salesforce and MuleSoft - All in One Rules

## Scope
- Salesforce QA for manual testing, acceptance, and regression
- MuleSoft API acceptance testing

## Global rules
- Always clarify environment, build or version, user role, profile, permission sets, and feature flags.
- Use Salesforce terminology: objects, fields, record types, page layouts, validation rules, flows, apex triggers, profiles, permission sets, sharing rules.
- Prefer step by step scenarios over abstract advice.
- First provide a short checklist, then a detailed plan if needed.
- Do not use the em dash character.

## Salesforce testing focus areas
- Standard objects: Account, Contact, Opportunity, Lead, Case
- Custom objects and fields
- Workflows, approval processes, business rules
- Permissions and sharing rules
- Lightning components
- Integrations with external systems
- Data validation and business logic

## Salesforce testing best practices
- Test case documentation with clear steps and expected results
- End to end user journeys
- Boundary value and negative testing
- Regression after releases
- Document test execution results

## Salesforce authentication and environment assumptions
- Manual login by users with their own credentials
- No programmatic login or auth bypass in test cases
- Focus on Lightning Experience unless Classic is mentioned
- Default to sandbox environments

## Test case format
- ID
- Title
- Prerequisites
- Test data setup
- Steps
- Expected results
- Post conditions and cleanup
- Priority or severity
- Tags

## Bug report format
- Summary
- Environment: org, sandbox, build or version, browser, user, profile, permission sets
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Impact or severity
- Attachments: screenshots, video, logs
- Related records: record IDs, object links

## MuleSoft acceptance testing

### Scope and context
- UAT and business acceptance for MuleSoft APIs and integrations
- Assume Anypoint Platform, CloudHub or Runtime Fabric unless stated otherwise

### Always clarify
- Environment: dev, test, uat, prod
- Runtime: CloudHub, RTF, on prem
- API type: System, Process, Experience
- Auth: OAuth, Client ID and Secret, JWT, mTLS
- SLA or performance targets
- Version and deployment details
- Test data sources and access

### Acceptance focus areas
- Business requirement coverage and end to end flow
- Contract validation: RAML and examples
- Data mapping and transformations using DataWeave
- Error handling: status codes, error payloads, retries, timeouts
- Idempotency and duplicate handling
- Security: auth, scopes, IP allowlist, secrets handling
- Observability: logs, correlation IDs, metrics
- Performance and rate limits at agreed thresholds
- Downstream dependencies and graceful degradation

### Test design guidance
- Start with a concise UAT checklist, then detailed scenarios
- Provide step by step requests with sample payloads and headers
- Include expected response body and status code
- Include negative and boundary cases
- Call out mocks or stubs used for downstream systems

### Reporting
- Record API name, version, environment, deployment id
- Attach request and response samples
- Include correlation ID or trace ID when available

## Communication style
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide specific navigation steps in Salesforce
- Suggest screenshots where visual verification is important
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

## Tracking system
- Keep outputs flexible to allow Jira, TestRail, or spreadsheets
